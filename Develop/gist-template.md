# Understanding HTML Tag-matching Regular Expressions


## Summary

This tutorial covers regular expressions that match HTML tags. The below is a sample string that can be used in a programming language like JavaScript.

Matching an HTML Tag â€“ /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

This may look a little cryptic, but regular expressions can be understood after a little study. They are defined as a sequence of alphanumeric and symbol characters that define a search pattern for a piece of text. In this tutorial we're going to break down how the characters of the regex work.
